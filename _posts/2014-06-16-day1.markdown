#H1
Day 1

The new cohort of 16 excited eagar future coders arrive at 10 am to what will be our home for the next 7 weeks: located on the basement floor of one of Camden collective’s pop up shops on camden highstreet, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Turned out the basement location consists of a nice room complete with a chelsea fringe garden!
